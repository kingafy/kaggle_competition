43,Format 8,Severity lower bound,Numerical,"If the outcome being measured is risk of severe clinical symptoms of COVID-19, then use these columns to report the risk ratio, odds ratio, or hazard ratio, or adjusted risk ratio, adjusted odds ratio, or adjusted hazard ratio (RR, OR, HR, ARR, AOR, AHR) and its 95% confidence interval, and the p-value for the t-test that the value is not equal to 1.0 (i.e., the no effect level). Definitions of severe COVID-19 vary, and more than one definition may be acceptable. There is a separate column for recording the definition given for severity of clinical outcomes. Sometimes that definition includes a composite endpoint (e.g., mechanical ventilation OR death). This is still considered a measure of severity for our purposes. Only if the outcome is strictly survivors vs. non-survivors does this data go under the ‘Fatality’ / ‘Fatality lower bound’ / ‘Fatality upper bound’ / ‘Fatality p-value’ instead. If the comparison between survivors and non-survivors excludes those still hospitalized at the end of the follow-up interval, then the ‘Severe definition’ column should read ‘death vs. discharged’ rather than ‘survivors vs. non-survivors’. For the purposes of presenting our results to the public, we differentiate between two types of ‘Severe definition’ - ‘critical only’ and everything else. ‘Critical only’ means ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, multiple organ failure, or ARDS. Any definition that is broader than this (e.g., the classic definition of pneumonia severity) falls in the other category."
